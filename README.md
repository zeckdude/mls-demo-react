# MLS Demo React üè°

MLS Demo React is a conceptual demo of a real estate listings website that connects to the MLS (Multiple Listing Service) using the RETS API (Real Estate Transaction Standard API). It is built on React and showcases my ability to create engaging and user-friendly front-end interfaces that can integrate with various back-end systems.

## Live Demo

You can check out a live demo of MLS Demo React at [https://zeckdude.github.io/mls-demo-react/](https://zeckdude.github.io/mls-demo-react/). Please note that this demo is purely conceptual and not connected to a real MLS service.

## Installation and Usage

To install and run MLS Demo React locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/zeckdude/mls-demo-react.git`
2. Switch to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/zeckdude/mls-demo-react/tree/gh-pages) branch
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`

MLS Demo React uses the RETS API to fetch real estate data. To connect to a real MLS service, you will need to obtain an API key and configure the `rets.js` library accordingly.
